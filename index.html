  <section>
    I am currently working as a Site Reliability Engineer at Google. My
    <a href="TODO">thesis</a> studied techniques to apply software
    verification by reducing programs to a small higher-order and
    purely functional language. A large part of my research work has been
    to contribute to the development of
    <a href="https://github.com/epfl-lara/leon.git">Leon</a>.
